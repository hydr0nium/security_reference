# Here you can find some tricks I learned over the years of doing security work


## Python one line import
Python allows one line imports with the \_\_import\_\_ method. This can be used to run module code in one line to bypass restrictions. 
```py
__import__('some_module').some_function()
```

## Upgrade Reverse Shell with Python
When catching a reverse shell it's often just a primitive shell, that does not allow tab completion, ctrl-c or clear functionality.
Upgrading a primitive shell can solve these issues. First you need to spawn a proper pseudoterminal that acts like a normal terminal. 
This can be done via python with:
```bash
python -c "import pty; pty.spawn('/bin/bash')" # Spawn pseudo tty 
```
This allows you to interact with everything like you would with a normal terminal.
No we disable the echo so that our commands are not displayed twice and enable raw tty to pass commands like ctrl-c straight through to our pseudo terminal with:
```bash
# Press ctrl-z to background the reverse shell
stty -echo raw;fg # Run this in your terminal not. (If you run zsh the ;fg is needed otherwise it can be done in two commands)
# You might need to press enter one or two times
export TERM=xterm # Run in the pseudo terminal again to allow clear command
```

## Infinite Ping
On linux machines doing a ping results in a infinite running command. 
Thus pinging to check for command injection should be done with a max number of pings:
```bash
ping -c 5
```

## OS Fingerprinting with Ping
Different operating system have different inital TTL values when responding to a ping and thus can be fingerprinted:
```bash
ping -c 5 some_ip
# Linux TTL: Around 64
# Windows TTL Around 128
```

## Temporary Files
The `/dev/shm` 'directory' in Linux is a tempfs. The files placed in there are living in RAM only and thus are deleted with each reboot.
This makes it fast to write to and read from. 

## SSH Port Forwarding after connecting
When enabling `EnableEscapeCommandline` in your SSH config it is possible to use `~C` to change the SSH connection parameters allowing
to enable port forwarding and more. [See here](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config#EnableEscapeCommandline)

## Restriction Space Restrictions
If you are restricted of using spaces in your command inputs you might be able to bypass it with the following methods:
```bash
# 1. bash curly brace expansion
{echo,test} == echo test
# 2. IFS Variable
echo${IFS}test == echo test
```

## Fast root shell
If you only have restricted command injection as root you can try to change the permissions of /bin/bash to have the suid bit set, if you are already on the system
with another user.
```bash
chmod u+s /bin/bash
/bin/bash -p # as the other user
```
